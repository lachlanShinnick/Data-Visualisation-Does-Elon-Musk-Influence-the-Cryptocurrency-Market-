Data Visualisation investigating the correlation between Elon Musks' tweets and Bitcoin's price.

A Python visualization project was initiated to explore the above question. This involved examining Elon Musk's influential tweets about cryptocurrencies, analyzing different elements linked to these tweets and Bitcoin's fluctuations. 
Additionally, the project involved assessing the correlation between the frequency of cryptocurrency-related tweets and price fluctuations, along with investigating trading volume.

For this visualisation, I used several relevant libraries and packages including pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.dates, and datetime. Additionally, I imported timezone from the pytz module to handle time zone conversions.

You can observe the findings and insights derived from this investigation in the learning output attached.
